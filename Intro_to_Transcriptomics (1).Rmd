***Deliverables***
-Upload this R Notebook to your GitHub and submit the link to your Repo on BB.
-Include any graphs or figures created in this assignment in the folder with your R notebook with descriptive file names.

Since this is an optional partner activity, it is okay if your answers are the same as your partnerâ€™s as long as everyone understands it and could explain it in their own words if asked. Each person must individually push their code to Github. *At the top of your R Notebook, write the name of you and your partner(s) as a comment.*

***Complete the following coding activity and answer any following questions as comments in your R Notebook***

In Transcriptomics_Tutorial.Rmd, you learned how to manipulate the SummarizedExperiment data structure, turn it into more readable dataframes, complete basic analysis using those dataframes, and performed a differential expression analysis based on age. Before saving the rna_counts, rna_clinical, and rna_genes however, we masked out any sample that was not a tumor. In this assignment, you will need to reinstantiate the rna_se object and then perform differential expression analysis based on tumor status.

*Pre-Assignment*
Use knitr function to set your working directory to your analysis_data folder in qbio_490_name.
```{r}

```

Load all necessary packages and instantiate the rna_se object
```{r}

```


*1*
Perform all data cleaning and label manipulation steps (hint: applying colnames and rownames to make the dataframes more readable) except for masking out the patient with an NA for age and the "Solid Tissue Normal" sample types.
```{r}

```


*2*
Determine and define your experimental design for the differential expression analysis. Control for covariance of age, gender, OR vital_status. Manipulate those columns so that they are ready for differential expression analysis (hint: what kind of variables are they? what data type are they by default? do you need to handle unknown values?)
```{r}

```


*3*
Perform the differential expression analysis, create a volcano plot, and interpret what genes from each of the 6 sections means (assuming thresholds of -log10padj = 2 and log2FoldChange = 1)
```{r}

```

top-right genes: 
bottom-right genes: 
top-left genes: 
bottom-left genes: 
top-middle genes:
bottom-middle genes:

Save the picture of the volcano plot (using either ggsave() or right clicking and manually downloading the image and push this .Rmd and the image to GitHub)
